Decline of Truth.\"\n The issue discusses misinformation, \"not from a purely technical angle that monitors technological tools and strategies used (which have become more systematic), but from the point of view of its impact on free debate within society and undermining democracies in addition to turning victims into perpetrators.\"\n The issue featured 12 writers who addressed the topic of disinformation in its various forms and effects, starting with an article written by Muhammad Khamaysa on \"How does disinformation undermine public trust in the press?\". And in reflect to the massive influx of images and spread of fake accounts driven by artificial intelligence, Ahmed Jihad Al-Arja wrote an article titled: \"Armed Artificial Intelligence, a heavy guest on audit platforms.\"\n In the same context, Linda Shalash wrote: \"Fake accounts with Arabic masks, an organized electronic army\", while Arwa al-Kaali and Hossam al-Wakeel addressed the same issue from the angle of information verification platforms.\n As to practices of cutting news out of its genuine context adopted by international news agencies, Elijah Topper wrote: \"Half- truth is a complete lie,\". Following the roots of bias and amputation of context, Saeed Al-Hajji wrote: Disinformation and historical context, \"The struggle of memory against forgetfulness\".\n The issue focused on highlighting the human aspect and importance of the story as part of historical documentation of events through Lina Shank's article entitled: \"To live and tell my story\", and Hadeel Atallah's article: \"Muhammad Al-Sawaf... The film as a history of genocide.\"\n Other articles came in different titles such as: \"Indictment of being a journalist in Sudan\" written by Iman Kamal El-Din, and with regard to the effect of financing on controlling editorial agenda, Abdul Ahad Al-Rasheed wrote: In Senegal, \"Journalism without Journalism\" and finally, researcher Shaima Alesayi addressed the roles of Omani media in times of climate change."

The most important issues of the meeting, which was attended by journalists and editors of the network, were targeting of journalists, absence of international protection, and the great role of photo in refuting the narrative of Israeli occupation, reviewing some of the stories that highlight the ugliness of what is happening in Gaza at both humanitarian and professional levels.\n Bilal explained dangers and risks that face the journalist at Gaza Strip and the impact of those risks on his family, saying: Being a journalist in the Gaza Strip means that your life is threatened with death at every moment, your family's life is at risk too and you lose it any at moment because you are a journalist. This is the real picture of the situation of every journalist from Palestine. He also shed light on extra burden of Palestinians journalist who cover and document war crimes and at the same time look after their families, relatives and friends. He pointed out that during the war he realized how he could harmonize between his journalistic duties and his family commitments but, beyond any doubt, it was a great risk and a tiresome burden to complete your journalistic mission to the fullest and at the same time support your family under these difficult circumstances.\n These meetings are held with the aim of reflecting real stories, promoting awareness, providing a deeper understanding of the challenges that journalists face in war zones and the psychological and emotional scars that result from these experiences, in addition to focusing awareness to the importance of the role of journalists during wars, and providing the necessary psychological and professional support to those who have undergone such dangerous experiences."

Documenting the Crime\", presented by Aljazeera correspondent in Palestine, Heba Akileh.\n Akila revealed, for the first time, details of stories that happened at the backstage coverage of Aljazeera and talked about events that she faced with colleagues working in Aljazeera bureau in Gaza and other journalists in the Strip. She pointed out that the scale of tragedy transmitted by the cameras is only a small fraction of the real anguish that people of Gaza are facing, criticizing the biased Western coverage of the Israeli narrative.\n Akila stressed the need to humanize journalistic stories so that the viewer does not get used to images of killing and destruction as the war continues for more than six months, stressing that the deliberate Israeli targeting of journalists and their families in order to continue exterminating Palestinian people silently in the darkness without witnesses or documentation. She also devoted a special portion for the situation of women journalists focused on \"What does it mean to be a field journalist in Gaza?\" where she explained suffering of female journalists in general, and female journalist mothers in particular, such as lack of privacy and many other impacts of the war on them.\n On the first day of the workshop, Akila revealed that she was seriously ill and forced to leave Gaza Strip, due to the lack of required health care in Gaza hospitals as a result of Israeli aggression. She also devoted a part of the workshop to interact with the followers, where they focused largely on the situation in Gaza Strip and how to convey the real event to a wider public.\n On the second day of the workshop, Aljazeera correspondent in Palestine, Heba Akileh, explained her displacement journey in Gaza Strip, and also talked about the martyrdom of colleague Samer Abu Daqqa, and deliberate targeting of families of the rest of her colleague journalists, stressing that the impact of targeting families of journalists multiplies the pains of a journalist and puts him into a difficult psychological situation that doesn’t disappear over time.\n The workshop concluded by providing advice to journalists on how to prepare for field coverage, dealing with sources and on-air updating of information, and how to deal with various difficult circumstances and situations, especially logistic problems such as power outages and communications and the Internet interruptions."

Participants will have the opportunity to integrate into one of the working teams within the Al Jazeera Media Network, gaining an intimate understanding of the work environment. They will engage with editors, journalists, and colleagues pertinent to their research topic. Additionally, participants will operate in a conducive environment offering diverse experiences, academic and professional support and guidance.
